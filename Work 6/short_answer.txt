Q1. Use the above encoding tree to decode the bit sequence `0101100011`.
A1. MOONS

Q2. Prepare a table for the above encoding tree that lists each character with its assigned bit sequence.
Use your table to encode the string `"SONS"`.
A2.
S = 011
N = 01
M = 010
O = 1
011101011

Q3. Flatten the encoding tree above on the right into its sequence of bits and sequence of characters.
A3. TODO

Q4. Unflatten the sequences `110100100` and `FLERA` to reconstruct the original encoding tree.
A4. TODO

Q5. Construct a Huffman coding tree for the input `"BOOKKEEPER"`.
A5. TODO

Q6. Calculate the entropy of your Huffman tree for `"BOOKKEEPER"`.
Confirm that if you had chosen to break ties in a different manner when constructing the tree,
this alternate tree has the same entropy as the optimal result.
A6. TODO
